🧠 PSYC 3040: Sensation & Perception
Course Project Instructions
🎯 Overview

For your course project, you’ll create something creative that connects to the material from Sensation & Perception.
Your project can take many forms — examples include:

Building a visual illusion or optical artifact

Conducting an interview with someone who has a sensory deficit

Experiencing and documenting a unique sensory event

Comparing your tactile acuity (touch sensitivity) across different body parts

Mapping the loudness of the GT whistle across campus

Let your imagination run wild! The only requirement is that your project must relate to perception (it doesn’t have to be a topic covered in class).
