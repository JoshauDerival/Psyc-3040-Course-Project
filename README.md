Psyc 3040: Sensation & Perception
Instructions for Course Project
General Instructions
The course project will require you to do something creative that relates to the material in the
class. This can be a physical artifact of a visual illusion that you build, an interview you conduct
with someone that has a sensory deficit, a strange sensory experience that you go through and
document, comparing your tactile acuity (sensitivity to touch) for different body parts, mapping
of the loudness of the GT whistle in different places on campus, etc. Let your imagination run
wild. The only requirement is that it has to be related to perception (though it’s ok if the topic
of the video was not covered in class).
The output of the project needs to be a video where you showcase what you did. The video
should be between 1 and 1.5 minutes long. Videos shorter than 1 minute or longer than 1.5
minutes will be penalized by 1 point for every 30 seconds below or above the limits. You should
upload the video on YouTube and only submit a link to your video on Canvas. Late submissions
will be penalized by one point for every 24 hours past the deadline.
Scoring rubric
The project will be scored out of 10 points based on the following four criteria: (1) originality,
(2) informativeness, (3) accuracy, and (4) clarity of the video presentation. Scoring will be done
on the following scale:
• 10: A truly exceptional presentation that stands out from the rest.
• 9: A great overall presentation that is original, informative, accurate, and clear.
• 8: A very good overall presentation that moderately lacks in at least one category (e.g.,
it’s not original).
• 7: A good overall presentation that severely lacks in at least one category OR
moderately lacks in several categories.
• 6: A deficient presentation that severely lacks in several categories.
• 1-5: Presentations that did not follow the instructions or are generally unacceptable as
college-level work.
